1. **
   Judging Mechanism:**
   - **Sandboxing:** Develop a secure sandbox environment to execute user-submitted code. This involves restricting access to system resources to prevent malicious activities. Tools like Docker can be helpful in creating isolated environments.
   - **Resource Limitations:** Implement mechanisms to enforce resource limitations on submissions, such as execution time, memory usage, and file access.
   - **Output Comparison:** Develop a robust system for comparing the output of user submissions with the expected output, considering factors like whitespace and precision.
2. **Scoring System:**
   - **Scoring Algorithms:** Design and implement scoring algorithms for different types of problems (e.g., competitive programming, algorithmic challenges). Consider factors like correctness, efficiency, and time complexity in scoring.
   - **Partial Scoring:** Allow for partial scoring to reward partial solutions and encourage users to submit even if they haven't solved the entire problem.
3. **Real-time Feedback:**
   - **Instant Verdicts:** Provide users with instant feedback on their submissions, including information about correctness, execution time, and memory usage.
   - **Compile-Time Errors:** Detect and report compile-time errors to users before attempting to execute their code.
4. **Support for Multiple Programming Languages:**
   - **Language Support:** Include support for multiple programming languages commonly used in competitive programming, such as C++, Java, Python, etc.
   - **Version Compatibility:** Ensure that the judge system supports different versions of programming languages and libraries to accommodate a wide range of user submissions.
5. **Security Considerations:**
   - **Code Review:** Implement a thorough code review process to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities in user-submitted code.
   - **Limiting System Access:** Restrict access to system-level commands and external libraries to prevent unauthorized actions.
6. **Problem Repository:**
   - **Problem Metadata:** Develop a system to store and retrieve metadata about problems, including statements, input/output formats, and example test cases.
   - **Version Control for Problems:** Implement version control for problems to track changes over time and facilitate updates.
7. **Contest Management:**
   - **Contest Timing:** Implement features for managing contests, including start and end times, duration, and freeze time (when users can no longer submit solutions).
   - **Leaderboards:** Create leaderboards to display real-time rankings based on user performance during a contest.
8. **User Management:**
   - **User Profiles:** Allow users to create profiles, track their progress, and view their submission history.
   - **Submission History:** Maintain a detailed history of user submissions, including the ability to rejudge submissions.
9. **Anti-Cheating Measures:**
   - **Plagiarism Detection:** Implement algorithms or integrate with tools that can detect code similarities to identify potential cases of plagiarism.
   - **Randomized Test Cases:** Use randomized test cases to ensure that solutions are not hardcoded to pass specific inputs.
10. **Custom Test Cases and Input Generation:**
    - **Custom Test Case Support:** Allow problem setters to define custom test cases for their problems.
    - **Input Generation:** Provide tools or scripts for generating large-scale test cases to test the scalability and efficiency of solutions.

Building an Online Judge system involves a combination of software engineering, algorithms, security, and system design. Consider these specific techniques to ensure your system is capable of handling the unique challenges posed by evaluating and scoring diverse programming submissions.
