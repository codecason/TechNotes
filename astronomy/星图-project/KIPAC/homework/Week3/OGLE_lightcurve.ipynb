    "An excellent resource for gravitational lensing background (among other things) is [Peter Schneider's _Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology_](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642540820). It looks like we can download a pdf of the entire book for free (at least from within the Stanford network), which is awesomeness incarnate. The relevant section for Galactic microlensing is 2.5 (logical page 77), and the equations defining the microlensing model lightcurve are 2.92 and 2.93. Namely,\n",

    "You'll of course also need the transformation between flux and magnitude, above. For convenience, let's parameterize the normalization of the model lightcurve in magnitudes rather than flux, i.e. $I_0$ rather than $F_0$; that way, all of the \"ref\" quantities in the magnitude definition are absorbed into this new parameter and we won't have to worry about them explicitly. With that substitution, the model parameters are $I_0$, $p$, $t_\\mathrm{max}$ and $t_\\mathrm{E}$. Following the discussion in Schneider, you should be able to come up with order-of-magnitude guesses at the correct values of these parameters.\n",

    "Lacking any better information, we'll assume that the sampling distributions for the magnitude measurements are Gaussian and independent, with means given by the \"magnitude\" column and standard deviations given by the \"magnitude error\" column, and that the time stamps are exact."

(Originally, this was going to specify the maximum-probability convention for best fit and CI, but I don't want everyone to be sidetracked by the lack of an easy-to-use function to calculate them. If you do have the time and desire to write such a function in Python, I'll bet all of your classmates will be grateful.)\n",
