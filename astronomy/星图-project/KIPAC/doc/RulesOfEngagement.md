# Physics 366 Rules of Engagement

To ensure that the interactions in and out of the classroom remain positive, we expect everyone involved in this course to abide by the following guidelines, which borrow extensively from the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/manual), the [LSSTC Data Science Fellowship Program](https://astrodatascience.org), and the estimable Prof. Pat Burchat.

## Electronic Devices

Research has shown that while using an electronic device in the classroom decreases learning performance, having the person sitting  next to you using a device is even more detrimental [1].
We can attest that it's also distracting to the instructors.
Therefore, we ask that you never use a phone, laptop or tablet during class except when we explicitly ask you to use your laptop for an activity.
This also applies to using your laptop to follow along with the slides being presented in the lecture.
If you're worried about something going past too quickly and want us to pause on a slide or go backwards for a moment, you're probably not the only one.
Ask!

## Promoting Questions

Fear of asking questions can be a pernicious impediment to learning.
This fear frequently keeps us from asking the very most important questions, like "how does that work?" or even just "why?"
Worse, it keeps us from saying "I don't understand."
Rest assured, your instructors (and everyone they know) say these things *all the time*.

Keep in mind is that being able to explain a concept is the ultimate test of understanding, and it's entirely possible to believe we have an understanding right up to the moment we try to explain it to someone else [2]. It follows that asking questions during class and in break-out discussions isn't slowing things down; _it's providing a service_.

## Some Social Rules

To facilitate the most effective and inclusive learning environment by promoting deliberate exploration of what we  *don’t* know, we have a few of "social rules", adapted from Recurse.
These are not strict rules whose violation will get you summarily removed from class.
However, they *do* point to things that we should all be on the lookout for in our behavior - and if we notice ourselves breaking these rules we should respond by apologizing and endeavoring to break the habit instead.

* **No feigning surprise:** To enable everyone to be comfortable saying "I don't understand", please resist the urge to act surprised when someone admits to not knowing something.
Feigning surprise has no social or educational benefit, and functions as a put-down even when not intended as such.

* **No well-actually's:** A well-actually happens when someone says something that's almost - but not entirely - correct, and you say, "well, actually..." and then give a minor correction.
This is especially annoying when the correction has no bearing on the actual conversation.
If you feel the need to correct someone, take a moment to consider whether your correction is in the spirit of truth-seeking, rather than grandstanding, and whether it will provide a positive contribution to the discussion.

* **No subtle-isms:** It goes without saying that overt expressions of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia or other biases are unacceptable. We also need to avoid *subtle* expressions of bias that can make others uncomfortable and that are of no benefit to the learning environment. For example, the expression "It's so easy my grandmother could do it" is a subtle-ism.
