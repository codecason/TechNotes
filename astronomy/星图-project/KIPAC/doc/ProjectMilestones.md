# Final Project Milestones

To make sure that final projects aren't left for the last minute, we have various milestones defined.
With the exception of the last two, these should be submitted in a similar way to the homeworks, e.g. the first in
a `Project Milestones/Pitch/<your names>` folder in the private course repo.
Activity for the "Paper Outline" and "Paper Writing" milestones happens in `Project Reports/<your project>` folders, and no
special submissions are necessary - just commits of drafts and final versions of your reports.

Like homeworks, these appear in the [schedule](Schedule.md) in the week they are assigned, and are due the following week.

### Pitch

This comes just after the "Project Speed Dating" tutorial.
At this point, we are not locked into a particular set of projects.
With your team, write up a proto-abstract for your project concept, explaining what you want to learn, what data can help, and roughly how you plan to proceed.


### Abstract

Refine your project ideas after recieving feedback on your pitches, and continuing to brainstorm on your own.
Update the pitch (which we will now arbitrarily call an abstract) to reflect any changes.


### Plan, PGM

At this point, you should have an idea and a team that you expect to stick with.
Your task this week is to submit a rough plan for what you aim to accomplish, i.e. the scope of the project, and a guess at when various things will be done.
In addition, sketch a PGM for the model involved in your project.


### Data Visualization

By now, you should have identified what data you plan to use, obtained it, and played around a little.
Prove it by submitting some kind of visualization of the data.


### Action

Hopefully, you're now making concrete progress on your projects.
Submit anything (say, a plot of some intermediate result) to show off your work so far. With a description, please!


### Paper Outline

Exactly what it sounds like: a skeleton for the report you will be writing.
If you are already committing paper drafts to the repository, there's no need to submit anything special.


### Paper Writing

A finished report, committed in the `Project Reports` folder of the repo. **Your project report pull requests are due 1700 PDT on Weds June 12**
