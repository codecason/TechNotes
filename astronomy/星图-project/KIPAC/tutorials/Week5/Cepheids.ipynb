    "## Hierarchical Modeling of the Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cepheids are stars whose brightness oscillates with a stable period, the logarithm of which appears to be strongly correlated with their mean absolute magnitude. If this period-luminosity relation is universal, this would give us a way to measure the distance to galaxies containing Cepheid stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem we'll use the data from Riess et al. (2011; R11) to infer, hierarchically, the hyperparameters that govern the cepheid period-luminosity relation in a sample of nearby galaxies, and answer the following question: \n",
    "\n",
    "* How universal is the cepheid period-luminosity relation, once the distances to the galaxies is taken into account?\n",
    "\n",
    "A universal relation would lead to each galaxy showing the same slope and intercept in their cepheids' P-L relation. However, it could be that cepheid hosts are only *approximately* universal with regard to their cepheids, with the parameters of the period-luminosity relation following some broad, peaked distribution. By modeling the R11 dataset under this assumption of approximate universality we can infer the width of this distribution, and see how universal the P-L relation is."
