Almost, but not quite - there is still a residual *intrinsic scatter*, even after this correction.\n",

The flux is related to the SNIa's intrinsic luminosity by a distance which is a function of its (measured) redshift, $z$. The color and stretch of the SNIa are also measured; these relate the actual luminosity to the \"standard\" SNIa luminosity. However, there is a scatter, which we assume to be Gaussian, between the actual luminosities of SNIa and this standard luminosity. The parameters that we ultimately care about are the average standard luminosity, $\\bar{L}$, and the intrinsic scatter, $\\sigma$.\n",

From this type of data, we can measure gas temperatures and estimate the total gravitating mass (assuming the gas is in equilibrium with the gravitational potential). However, temperature is one of the observables needed in the hydrostatic equation to compute the mass (the other being gas density), so any uncertainty in the temperature measurement propagates to the mass.\n",

A standard model for this is a power-law, $T\\propto M^\\beta$, with a log-normal intrinsic scatter (see last exercise).
