
Forced Photometry: Inferring the AGN Flux given a Fixed PSF model and Source Position
The simplest inference we can do is one where we assume that almost all our model parameters are fixed, and the only free parameter to infer is the flux. This measurement process is sometimes known as "forced photometry".

Draw the PGM for this situation, showing separate nodes for each model parameter
Write out the expression for the factorized joint PDF for all data and parameters.
