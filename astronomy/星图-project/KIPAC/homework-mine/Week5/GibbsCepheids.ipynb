    "1. **Make a copy** of this notebook in your clone of the [**private** course repository](https://github.com/abmantz/phys366_2019). Edit that copy, not the version in the public repository clone. Please *follow the instructions in the [private repo README](https://github.com/abmantz/phys366_2019/blob/master/README.md)* by locating your solutions on a path like `phys366_2019/HW_week<N>/<Your Name(s)>/` and note that *case matters*. Take a minute to look hard at the directory structure and choose your filenames carefully: **if your solutions are not in the right place they will not be graded**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that, from here on out, these milestones will be organized in the repo **by project rather than by person**. Therefore, push your (team's) abstract to your fork of the **private repo** in a folder like `phys366_2019/Project_milestones/<project name>/` and submit a PR to the **private** repository. Like the pitch, you can write your abstract in either markdown, plain text, or jupyter notebook form. Do include your names as authors of the abstract, so we know who is working on which project.\n",

Alternatively, you could export the tutorial notebook as Python code and use `exec(open('mytutorial.py').read())` here. In that case, your solution should include both that raw code and the tutorial notebook (with outputs), since that stuff is part of the solution."
