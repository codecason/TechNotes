- Concurrency and Parrallesim
Hyperthreading, sometimes calledsimultaneous multi-threading, is a technique that allows a single CPU to execute multiple flows of control.

Thread-Level Concurrency: multi-core
Instruction-Level Concurrency: pipeline
SIMD Concurrency:special IO hardware

A pipeline can overlap phases the execution of an instruction with previous instructions.[1]
Three controls hazards: Read after write(RAW, so are the next), WAW, WAR
